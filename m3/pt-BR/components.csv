That's where search functions come in. Let's take a look at how it works, and how you can find anything on the internet.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>First up, you need to go to a search engine. These are websites that allow you to search for the things that you want and will deliver a page full of potentially useful results based on the text that you enter. When you open the browser, it might already go to the default search engine. If not, then enter the address of the search engine in the address bar. You can copy and paste it from the text in this course. You can also change the default search engine in the settings menu. Click or tap Settings, then click or tap Search Engine, then choose your favorite.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Now, type something into the search bar and press Enter or tap Go. You'll get a list of websites that the search engine thinks are relevant to your search, as well as related searches. You can also specify your searches by type. You can search for images, videos, or shopping results.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Let's do something more advanced. Let's use quotes. When you're looking for an exact phrase or specific terminology, placing your query in quotes tells the search engine to fetch pages with that exact wording.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Next, excluding words. By placing a minus sign before a word, you exclude it from your search results. This is perfect for narrowing down results when you're bombarded with irrelevant information.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Focusing your search on a single website can often yield better results. Use ""site:"" followed by the URL. This function is invaluable for academic research or when you trust a particular source for reliable information.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Searching for specific file types? ""filetype:"" is your go-to operator. Whether it's PDFs, PPTs, or Docs, this function streamlines finding downloadable resources.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>You can also specify how far back you want your search to go. Just go to Tools or Search Tools and select a time frame.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>If you can master these search operators, you'll be able to find exactly what you're looking for quickly and with precision.</strong></p>"

"components/663252dde3a21e04b1c6bf41/_html/","<h2>Identifying Relevant Results</h2>

<p>Relevant search results directly answer your query with precise, authoritative information. These results match your search keywords and are typically from credible sources such as well-known media outlets, academic institutions, or established experts.</p>

<p>Look for content that is up-to-date, especially for topics where it’s important to have the latest information. The relevance of a search result also hinges on its alignment with your search intent—whether you're seeking specific facts, a particular website, or a product.</p>

<h2>Spotting Irrelevant Results</h2>

<p>Irrelevant results may appear related to your query at a glance but fail to provide useful information upon closer inspection. These pages may only be minimally related to what you’re looking for. Misleading titles or meta descriptions that promise one thing but deliver another are common markers of irrelevance. Many websites try to game the search engines so that they appear at the top of the search lists, but when you visit their website, you discover that they don’t really contain what you’re looking for.</p>

<h2>Avoiding Malicious Results</h2>

<p>Malicious results pose a significant threat, potentially compromising your online safety. Be wary of results with suspicious URLs that attempt to mimic legitimate sites, or pages that ask you to download something the moment you arrive. Don’t agree to download anything unless you are sure that it is safe.</p>

<p>Your browser or security software may issue warnings about dangerous sites—heed these alerts.</p>

<h2>Best Practices for Safe Searching</h2>

<p>Enhance your search experience by critically evaluating URLs and verifying the credibility of information sources. You can also install security tools, like browser extensions and antivirus software, and we’ll show you more about that later. These provide an additional safeguard against malicious websites.</p>

<p>By applying these strategies, you'll become more adept at sifting through search results to find the information you need while protecting yourself from irrelevant or harmful content. Remember, successful searching is as much about discernment and caution as it is about knowing what keywords to use.</p>

"components/66325d3c422efe0538469bbb/_transcript/inlineTranscriptBody/","<p dir=""ltr""><strong>There will be times when you are looking for specific information on a web page or in a file or document. Luckily, there are several ways that you can find exactly what you're looking for. Let's see how to do it.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>The first way is through the menu at the top of the screen. Most applications and programs have a menu that begins at the top left of the screen and goes to the top right. When you click these words, a drop down list will appear, and you'll have more options that you can choose from. Each menu is unique to each application, but they usually contain the same or similar options. The first is usually File, followed by Edit and View, and then some others that will change depending on the application. The Find function is usually found under the Edit menu. Click the word Edit, then look for the word Find or Search. Click that and a small field or pop up window will appear somewhere on the screen. You might have to look for it, because different applications place it in different locations. When you've found it, type what you're looking for and press Enter or click the magnifying glass icon. You should see all instances of that word or phrase highlighted, and a number telling you how many times it appears on the page or in the document. If you don't see anything, it means that there are no instances of what you've searched for. Sometimes you'll see a Replace option, and this is a quick way to find and replace specific words in a document. You can often use the more advanced search features that we talked about in the video on searching with a web browser, although not all the functions support them.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>The second way to look for stuff on a webpage or inside a document is to use the shortcut keys. All of the most common functions in an application are accessible via shortcut keys. This is a combination of keys that you can press on your keyboard to perform that function without having to use the mouse and click on a menu or button. If you use the same application all the time and you find yourself performing the same functions over and over again, it's a good idea to learn the keyboard shortcuts for those functions. They will save you time and help you do things faster. In the case of the Find function, the shortcut key is usually CTRL and F on a Windows or Linux computer, or CMD and F on a Mac computer. First, press and hold CTRL, and when you're holding it, press F, and then release everything. The Find window will appear, just as if you clicked on it from the menu with the mouse. The rest of the steps are exactly the same as before.</strong></p>"

Sometimes it's blue text with an underline, but generally it's text that is somehow styled differently from the rest. When you position or hover the pointer over them, the pointer will change from an arrow to a hand. These are links, and they are clickable. What that means is that if you click on them, something will happen. The webpage might open a dropdown list, or it might load an image or a video, but more often than not it will take you away from this page and load another page or another website. Let's click this one. It loads another page on the same website. If you want to go back to the page you just left, you can use the back button. If you click the back button, reload the page you were just on, and then want to go back to the new page, you can either click the same link again, or you can click the forward button.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>If you leave one website and go to another and it's the first time you're visiting that website, you will be asked to select your cookie preferences. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites send to your device, your computer, your smartphone, or your tablet, whenever you visit them. Think of them as little notes that the website leaves on your device so that it can remember you and your preferences the next time you visit.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Cookies are important, so let's take a minute to understand them. They are used for several different things. When you visit a website, it might ask you to log in, choose a language, or select a theme. A cookie saves these choices, so the next time you visit the site, it remembers your preferences without you having to re-enter them. It's like a cafe, where the staff knows your order because you come in regularly.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Cookies help websites understand how you use them. For example, if you frequently visit certain pages on a site, cookies might help the website suggest other content you might like. If you go into a second-hand bookstore and spend a few minutes talking to the owner, he or she will probably be able to make some really good suggestions for books that you would like.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>For online stores, cookies are crucial. They remember what you've added to your shopping cart, even if you navigate away from the page. Without cookies, your cart would reset every time you clicked a new link.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Advertisers use cookies to track which websites you visit so they can show you ads they think you'll be interested in. It's like seeing billboards for products that you've recently talked about or looked at. While most people are happy to have cookies remember their preferences, a lot of people do not like the idea of advertisers following them around the internet as they browse. Imagine an advertising agency following you around the shopping mall, making notes of every item you look at, how long you look at it, and whether or not you decide to buy it.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>So while cookies are very useful, they've raised privacy concerns because they can track a lot of what you do online. Due to regulations and browser updates, you now have more control over cookies, letting you block or delete them if you choose. That's why we have to make those selections the first time we visit a website. In the end, each website is different when it comes to cookies. Some are more upfront than others, so it's worthwhile spending a few moments reading about what the website plans to do with your information. If you don't like what you read, then you don't have to accept it. You can reject the website's cookies. Most websites will allow you to go ahead and view their pages without accepting the cookies, but some might not. If that's the case, you have to decide how much you want to view that website. Maybe it's better to find the information somewhere else.</strong></p>"

Think of it like saving a page in a book to quickly return to it later.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>A bookmark in a digital context works similarly to a physical bookmark in a book. In your web browser, when you bookmark a website, you're saving its web address. This way, you can easily return to the site without typing the address again or searching for it. It's perfect for websites you visit frequently.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>First, let's open your web browser. Here, we're using Chrome. Look for the browser icon on your desktop or mobile device and open it, either by double-clicking or by tapping on it, or search for it in the search bar. Now, navigate to the website you want to bookmark. You do this by typing the website's address in the address bar. Let's bookmark www.wikipedia.org. Type it in and press Enter or tap Go. On the desktop, look for the bookmark icon in your browser's address bar. In Chrome, it's a star on the right side. This star is our key to saving a bookmark. On Android, tap the menu icon, that's the three vertical dots, and look for the star. Click or tap on this star. This action will save the current website as a bookmark in your browser. You can click Done or Save if you just want to save the bookmark, but if you want to rename it, click Edit. You can also organize your bookmarks by creating folders to keep them in. On Android, if you want to name the bookmark, tap the star again, and then you can name it anything you want.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>To access the bookmarks, look at the bookmarks bar in your browser. Here you'll find the name of the bookmark you just created. Click on it any time for access to the website. But what if you made a mistake and you bookmarked something you didn't want to bookmark? Or maybe you no longer use that website, so you want to get rid of the bookmark to free up space in your bookmarks list. Easy, just go to the bookmarks, find the one you want to delete, click on it, and on the desktop browser, click Remove, and on Android, tap the menu beside the link, and tap Delete.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Done. That's it. You now know what a bookmark is and how to save and access it on your web browser. Remember, bookmarks are a convenient way to keep your favorite websites close at hand. Try bookmarking a few sites and see how it simplifies your browsing experience.</strong></p>"

Just like how your car belongs to you and nobody is allowed to use it without your permission, your ideas belong to you, and you get to decide what you and other people can do with those ideas. That applies in the digital world, just as much as in the real world. And your intellectual property is protected by a series of copyright laws. These laws vary from one country to another, but they all recognize that anything you create belongs to you. Just like in the real world, copyright law protects creators and ensures that they can control how their work is used online. With the internet being a vast repository of content, it's important to understand the different types of copyright available for both creators and users. Let's take a look at them.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Traditional copyright automatically protects original works of authorship the moment they are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. This includes written works, music, films, paintings, and photographs among others. The creator has exclusive rights to use, distribute, and modify their work. However, in the digital realm, it's super easy to copy and distribute content without permission. It's also not as simple as the real world. If my friend wants to borrow a book from me, I can lend it to her, and when she's finished reading it, she'll give it back to me. If that book is an e-book, I can just make a copy and give her that. But now there are two copies of the same book, and I paid for one, and she didn't. The author will get royalties from my purchase, but not from the copy I gave to her.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>To combat this, copyright owners use digital rights management, or DRM technologies, to prevent unauthorized sharing. If you buy an e-book from Amazon, for example, you will not be able to make a copy of it to give to your friend.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Traditional copyright is great if you want to make money from the work you create, but what if you don't care so much about money, and you want to create something that others can use? Creative Commons, or CC licenses, offer a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors. They allow creators to specify conditions under which their work may be used, shared, or modified. CC licenses range from the most permissive, CC BY, which only requires attribution, to the most restrictive, CC BY NC ND, which allows others to download the works and share them with others as long as they credit the author, but they can't change them in any way or use them commercially. These licenses facilitate the legal sharing and use of content on the internet, promoting a culture of collaboration and accessibility. With Creative Commons, more people will be able to use whatever you create, but you won't be making a lot of money.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Works in the public domain are not protected by copyright and can be used without permission for any purpose. This category includes works whose copyright has expired, works created by governments, such as the US federal government, and works specifically released into the public domain by their creators. Anything that has fallen out of copyright is available for you to use in any way you want. If you want to make a new Winnie the Pooh story, you can do that because the character from the book fell out of copyright in 2022. But not the Disney version, so be careful. That's still under copyright. If you want to use Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in your birthday party, go right ahead. But again, be careful, because while the music itself is no longer copyrighted, the recording of that music might be. You can also choose to release your work in the public domain. This means you will have no control over what others do with your work and you will make no money from it. If you make a picture that another artist incorporates into their own work and then sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you will get nothing.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Fair use, as it is known in the United States, and fair dealing in some other jurisdictions, are doctrines that allow limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. These exceptions are vital for freedom of expression and information on the internet, allowing users to engage with copyrighted works in ways that contribute to public discourse and knowledge. For example, we refer to real-world companies and apps in this course, all of which are copyrighted, but we are using them specifically to teach, so it falls under fair use. If you are reviewing a movie or a book, it's okay to show short clips or take short quotes so that your audience or readers understand what you're talking about. However, the application of fair use is highly context-specific, and it can lead to legal uncertainties in digital environments. A good rule of thumb is that if you're planning to create something with copyrighted material, that material should make up less than 10% of the overall work. And if you're planning to do something that will become very popular, you should talk to a lawyer before you do it.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Software copyright covers computer programs and sometimes their underlying code. With software being central to the functioning of the internet, copyright ensures that developers can control the use and distribution of their creations. Open source licenses are a notable subset, allowing software to be freely used, modified, and shared under designated terms to promote collaborative development and innovation. Let's say you're a programmer and you want to make a new version of Microsoft Office. It's pretty easy to view the source code, so you can just copy it, change the logo, and release it as your own product, right? No. The source code created by Microsoft is copyrighted, so you can't do that. If you want to make a new product based on Microsoft's product, you can certainly study it for inspiration, but you cannot copy it outright. Just like you can't take a Stephen King novel, change the cover, and sell it as your own.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>For sure, the internet has complicated the landscape of copyright law, challenging traditional notions of ownership and distribution. So while copyright provides essential protections for creators, it has also evolved to accommodate new forms of creation and sharing in the digital age.</strong></p>"

<p>If you have to add a website to a bibliography, you can do it in the same way as a traditional book or journal. Each system has its own way of presenting the information, so you should check the rules for that particular system, whether it be Harvard, Chicago, MLA, or something else.</p>

<p>However, there are a few differences. For example, how do you know what year the website was published? What if you can’t find the name of the author? Here’s what you do in such cases:</p>

<p>Authorship: If the author is not an individual (e.g., a corporation or organization), use the name of the organization as the author. If no author is available, you can start with the title of the web page or article.</p>

<p>Year of Publication: If the year is not available, use ""n.d."" to denote ""no date.""</p>

<p>Title of Web Page/Document: This should be in italics.</p>

<p>Website Name: If the name of the website is different from the author, include it after the title. If they are the same, you do not need to repeat it.</p>

<p>URL: Ensure the URL is complete and functional to direct readers exactly to the content referenced.</p>

<p>Access Date: This is the date that you viewed the website. Including the access date is crucial because web content can change over time, so it’s important to know when the information was accessed.</p>

Think of it like saving a page in a book to quickly return to it later.</p><p dir=""ltr"">A bookmark in a digital context works similarly to a physical bookmark in a book. In your web browser, when you bookmark a website, you're saving its web address. This way, you can easily return to the site without typing the address again or searching for it. It's perfect for websites you visit frequently.</p><p dir=""ltr"">First, let's open your web browser. Here, we're using Chrome. Look for the browser icon on your desktop or mobile device and open it, either by double-clicking or by tapping on it, or search for it in the search bar. Now, navigate to the website you want to bookmark. You do this by typing the website's address in the address bar. Let's bookmark www.wikipedia.org. Type it in and press Enter or tap Go. On the desktop, look for the bookmark icon in your browser's address bar. In Chrome, it's a star on the right side. This star is our key to saving a bookmark. On Android, tap the menu icon, that's the three vertical dots, and look for the star. Click or tap on this star. This action will save the current website as a bookmark in your browser. You can click Done or Save if you just want to save the bookmark, but if you want to rename it, click Edit. You can also organize your bookmarks by creating folders to keep them in. On Android, if you want to name the bookmark, tap the star again, and then you can name it anything you want.</p><p dir=""ltr"">To access the bookmarks, look at the bookmarks bar in your browser. Here you'll find the name of the bookmark you just created. Click on it any time for access to the website. But what if you made a mistake and you bookmarked something you didn't want to bookmark? Or maybe you no longer use that website, so you want to get rid of the bookmark to free up space in your bookmarks list. Easy, just go to the bookmarks, find the one you want to delete, click on it, and on the desktop browser, click Remove, and on Android, tap the menu beside the link, and tap Delete.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Done. That's it. You now know what a bookmark is and how to save and access it on your web browser. Remember, bookmarks are a convenient way to keep your favorite websites close at hand. Try bookmarking a few sites and see how it simplifies your browsing experience.</p>"

"components/2691ca0315644cafbb821f36b2ddba1e/_items/0/body/","<p dir=""ltr"">When you're visiting a website, you'll find a lot of things that look like this. Sometimes it's blue text with an underline, but generally it's text that is somehow styled differently from the rest. When you position or hover the pointer over them, the pointer will change from an arrow to a hand. These are links, and they are clickable. What that means is that if you click on them, something will happen. The webpage might open a dropdown list, or it might load an image or a video, but more often than not it will take you away from this page and load another page or another website. Let's click this one. It loads another page on the same website. If you want to go back to the page you just left, you can use the back button. If you click the back button, reload the page you were just on, and then want to go back to the new page, you can either click the same link again, or you can click the forward button.</p><p dir=""ltr"">If you leave one website and go to another and it's the first time you're visiting that website, you will be asked to select your cookie preferences. Cookies are small pieces of data that websites send to your device, your computer, your smartphone, or your tablet, whenever you visit them. Think of them as little notes that the website leaves on your device so that it can remember you and your preferences the next time you visit.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Cookies are important, so let's take a minute to understand them. They are used for several different things. When you visit a website, it might ask you to log in, choose a language, or select a theme. A cookie saves these choices, so the next time you visit the site, it remembers your preferences without you having to re-enter them. It's like a cafe, where the staff knows your order because you come in regularly.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Cookies help websites understand how you use them. For example, if you frequently visit certain pages on a site, cookies might help the website suggest other content you might like. If you go into a second-hand bookstore and spend a few minutes talking to the owner, he or she will probably be able to make some really good suggestions for books that you would like.</p><p dir=""ltr"">For online stores, cookies are crucial. They remember what you've added to your shopping cart, even if you navigate away from the page. Without cookies, your cart would reset every time you clicked a new link.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Advertisers use cookies to track which websites you visit so they can show you ads they think you'll be interested in. It's like seeing billboards for products that you've recently talked about or looked at. While most people are happy to have cookies remember their preferences, a lot of people do not like the idea of advertisers following them around the internet as they browse. Imagine an advertising agency following you around the shopping mall, making notes of every item you look at, how long you look at it, and whether or not you decide to buy it.</p><p dir=""ltr"">So while cookies are very useful, they've raised privacy concerns because they can track a lot of what you do online. Due to regulations and browser updates, you now have more control over cookies, letting you block or delete them if you choose. That's why we have to make those selections the first time we visit a website. In the end, each website is different when it comes to cookies. Some are more upfront than others, so it's worthwhile spending a few moments reading about what the website plans to do with your information. If you don't like what you read, then you don't have to accept it. You can reject the website's cookies. Most websites will allow you to go ahead and view their pages without accepting the cookies, but some might not. If that's the case, you have to decide how much you want to view that website. Maybe it's better to find the information somewhere else.</p>"

"components/e29dc68664944ab2af3592d7e2a0c66f/_items/0/body/","<p dir=""ltr"">There will be times when you are looking for specific information on a web page or in a file or document. Luckily, there are several ways that you can find exactly what you're looking for. Let's see how to do it.</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">The first way is through the menu at the top of the screen. Most applications and programs have a menu that begins at the top left of the screen and goes to the top right. When you click these words, a drop down list will appear, and you'll have more options that you can choose from. Each menu is unique to each application, but they usually contain the same or similar options. The first is usually File, followed by Edit and View, and then some others that will change depending on the application. The Find function is usually found under the Edit menu. Click the word Edit, then look for the word Find or Search. Click that and a small field or pop up window will appear somewhere on the screen. You might have to look for it, because different applications place it in different locations. When you've found it, type what you're looking for and press Enter or click the magnifying glass icon. You should see all instances of that word or phrase highlighted, and a number telling you how many times it appears on the page or in the document. If you don't see anything, it means that there are no instances of what you've searched for. Sometimes you'll see a Replace option, and this is a quick way to find and replace specific words in a document. You can often use the more advanced search features that we talked about in the video on searching with a web browser, although not all the functions support them.</strong></p><p dir=""ltr"">The second way to look for stuff on a webpage or inside a document is to use the shortcut keys. All of the most common functions in an application are accessible via shortcut keys. This is a combination of keys that you can press on your keyboard to perform that function without having to use the mouse and click on a menu or button. If you use the same application all the time and you find yourself performing the same functions over and over again, it's a good idea to learn the keyboard shortcuts for those functions. They will save you time and help you do things faster. In the case of the Find function, the shortcut key is usually CTRL and F on a Windows or Linux computer, or CMD and F on a Mac computer. First, press and hold CTRL, and when you're holding it, press F, and then release everything. The Find window will appear, just as if you clicked on it from the menu with the mouse. The rest of the steps are exactly the same as before.</strong></p>"

"components/ebdc6727d2064e069de93ec851f9d3f8/_items/0/body/","<p dir=""ltr"">Every day, millions of searches are conducted, but sometimes finding precisely what you need can be like looking for a needle in a haystack. That's where search functions come in. Let's take a look at how it works, and how you can find anything on the internet.</p><p dir=""ltr"">First up, you need to go to a search engine. These are websites that allow you to search for the things that you want and will deliver a page full of potentially useful results based on the text that you enter. When you open the browser, it might already go to the default search engine. If not, then enter the address of the search engine in the address bar. You can copy and paste it from the text in this course. You can also change the default search engine in the settings menu. Click or tap Settings, then click or tap Search Engine, then choose your favorite.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Now, type something into the search bar and press Enter or tap Go. You'll get a list of websites that the search engine thinks are relevant to your search, as well as related searches. You can also specify your searches by type. You can search for images, videos, or shopping results.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Let's do something more advanced. Let's use quotes. When you're looking for an exact phrase or specific terminology, placing your query in quotes tells the search engine to fetch pages with that exact wording.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Next, excluding words. By placing a minus sign before a word, you exclude it from your search results. This is perfect for narrowing down results when you're bombarded with irrelevant information.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Focusing your search on a single website can often yield better results. Use ""site:"" followed by the URL. This function is invaluable for academic research or when you trust a particular source for reliable information.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Searching for specific file types? ""filetype:"" is your go-to operator. Whether it's PDFs, PPTs, or Docs, this function streamlines finding downloadable resources.</p><p dir=""ltr"">You can also specify how far back you want your search to go. Just go to Tools or Search Tools and select a time frame.</p><p dir=""ltr"">If you can master these search operators, you'll be able to find exactly what you're looking for quickly and with precision.</p>"

Just like how your car belongs to you and nobody is allowed to use it without your permission, your ideas belong to you, and you get to decide what you and other people can do with those ideas. That applies in the digital world, just as much as in the real world. And your intellectual property is protected by a series of copyright laws. These laws vary from one country to another, but they all recognize that anything you create belongs to you. Just like in the real world, copyright law protects creators and ensures that they can control how their work is used online. With the internet being a vast repository of content, it's important to understand the different types of copyright available for both creators and users. Let's take a look at them.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Traditional copyright automatically protects original works of authorship the moment they are fixed in a tangible medium of expression. This includes written works, music, films, paintings, and photographs among others. The creator has exclusive rights to use, distribute, and modify their work. However, in the digital realm, it's super easy to copy and distribute content without permission. It's also not as simple as the real world. If my friend wants to borrow a book from me, I can lend it to her, and when she's finished reading it, she'll give it back to me. If that book is an e-book, I can just make a copy and give her that. But now there are two copies of the same book, and I paid for one, and she didn't. The author will get royalties from my purchase, but not from the copy I gave to her.</p><p dir=""ltr"">To combat this, copyright owners use digital rights management, or DRM technologies, to prevent unauthorized sharing. If you buy an e-book from Amazon, for example, you will not be able to make a copy of it to give to your friend.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Traditional copyright is great if you want to make money from the work you create, but what if you don't care so much about money, and you want to create something that others can use? Creative Commons, or CC licenses, offer a flexible range of protections and freedoms for authors. They allow creators to specify conditions under which their work may be used, shared, or modified. CC licenses range from the most permissive, CC BY, which only requires attribution, to the most restrictive, CC BY NC ND, which allows others to download the works and share them with others as long as they credit the author, but they can't change them in any way or use them commercially. These licenses facilitate the legal sharing and use of content on the internet, promoting a culture of collaboration and accessibility. With Creative Commons, more people will be able to use whatever you create, but you won't be making a lot of money.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Works in the public domain are not protected by copyright and can be used without permission for any purpose. This category includes works whose copyright has expired, works created by governments, such as the US federal government, and works specifically released into the public domain by their creators. Anything that has fallen out of copyright is available for you to use in any way you want. If you want to make a new Winnie the Pooh story, you can do that because the character from the book fell out of copyright in 2022. But not the Disney version, so be careful. That's still under copyright. If you want to use Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in your birthday party, go right ahead. But again, be careful, because while the music itself is no longer copyrighted, the recording of that music might be. You can also choose to release your work in the public domain. This means you will have no control over what others do with your work and you will make no money from it. If you make a picture that another artist incorporates into their own work and then sells for hundreds of thousands of dollars, you will get nothing.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Fair use, as it is known in the United States, and fair dealing in some other jurisdictions, are doctrines that allow limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research. These exceptions are vital for freedom of expression and information on the internet, allowing users to engage with copyrighted works in ways that contribute to public discourse and knowledge. For example, we refer to real-world companies and apps in this course, all of which are copyrighted, but we are using them specifically to teach, so it falls under fair use. If you are reviewing a movie or a book, it's okay to show short clips or take short quotes so that your audience or readers understand what you're talking about. However, the application of fair use is highly context-specific, and it can lead to legal uncertainties in digital environments. A good rule of thumb is that if you're planning to create something with copyrighted material, that material should make up less than 10% of the overall work. And if you're planning to do something that will become very popular, you should talk to a lawyer before you do it.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Software copyright covers computer programs and sometimes their underlying code. With software being central to the functioning of the internet, copyright ensures that developers can control the use and distribution of their creations. Open source licenses are a notable subset, allowing software to be freely used, modified, and shared under designated terms to promote collaborative development and innovation. Let's say you're a programmer and you want to make a new version of Microsoft Office. It's pretty easy to view the source code, so you can just copy it, change the logo, and release it as your own product, right? No. The source code created by Microsoft is copyrighted, so you can't do that. If you want to make a new product based on Microsoft's product, you can certainly study it for inspiration, but you cannot copy it outright. Just like you can't take a Stephen King novel, change the cover, and sell it as your own.</p><p dir=""ltr"">For sure, the internet has complicated the landscape of copyright law, challenging traditional notions of ownership and distribution. So while copyright provides essential protections for creators, it has also evolved to accommodate new forms of creation and sharing in the digital age.</p>"
