"components/662f6db9eec87d00843ac00c/_transcript/inlineTranscriptBody/","<p dir=""ltr""><strong>In the previous module, we looked at the many opportunities offered by modern technology and Internet connectivity. You're already familiar with some examples of everyday tasks that can be significantly simplified with technology. Now, it's time to delve into the technical aspects and get familiar with the tools you'll be using.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>For each of the tasks you want to complete, you will need a program or application. This could be a web browser to access specific websites, or a program for editing text files. In order to launch them on your device, the operating system must be running. The operating system is the software that enables you to use your device, provides you with a graphical interface so that you can easily see what is happening and allows applications to run. You will also use it to customize your settings and organize the files you want to use or store on your device.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>You can use most websites, programs, and applications on both a computer and a smartphone or tablet. There are also many applications dedicated to touchscreens and those that are much easier to use on a computer, such as office software packages. The most common operating systems are Windows for PC, Mac OS for Apple, Android for smartphones, and iOS for iPhones. There is also Linux, which is very popular with programmers, but it's less easy for beginners. We'll be focusing on Windows and Android, since these are by far the most popular operating systems. But we'll try to be as general as possible. So if you're using a Mac or an iPhone, you'll be able to understand the concepts.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>If you are using a desktop computer, you will need several input/output devices. What are they? Input devices are used to enter information, like a keyboard or a mouse, while output devices transmit information to you, such as a monitor or speakers. If you use a laptop, it is equipped with all the necessary components. It has a built-in keyboard, monitor, speakers, microphone, and touchpad, which is the equivalent of a mouse. However, this doesn't mean you can't connect an external keyboard, mouse, or additional monitor. Such a solution may be more convenient if you intend to work for a long time and is often used in office environments. An external keyboard and mouse are more ergonomic and allow you to set the monitor at the right height.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>How do these devices connect to each other? They either connect with cables or they connect wirelessly. The basic types of cables you are sure to encounter are USB and HDMI. USB is used to connect external devices like keyboards, hard drives, mice, and trackpads, while HDMI connects monitors. Wireless devices may come with a small USB plug. When inserted into the appropriate socket, the device connects to the computer without a cable. Or they can also connect directly via Bluetooth, which is a system for connecting devices to each other wirelessly. And it works only over a short distance, around 10 meters or 30 feet. Wireless devices require batteries, so if your device stops working, the first thing you should do is check the battery. To connect a device via Bluetooth, you need to enable Bluetooth in the settings menu. On Windows, it will be a dropdown menu on the taskbar, and on a smartphone, it will be the menu that appears when you drag down the home screen. Through Bluetooth, you can also connect an external keyboard to a tablet and use it in a very laptop-like manner.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Let's talk a little more about the operating system, because whichever device you choose, you're going to encounter it. An important part of the operating system interface is the taskbar. This is where you'll find icons for the file explorer, the web browser, and the settings menu. Anytime you open and run an application, an icon will appear here. You can pin the ones you use most often to the taskbar. On the right side of the taskbar is the date and time. If you click on it, the calendar expands. Next to it, you can see icons for battery status, sound, and internet connection. Clicking here reveals more options, such as volume control, screen brightness adjustment, Wi-Fi network selection, airplane mode, and Bluetooth settings. From this menu, you can also access more advanced settings by clicking the cogwheel icon. To get started, you will certainly find File Explorer useful. Here, you'll find out how much storage space your device has, as well as the exact location of the files stored on it. To open the File Explorer, click on the folder icon on the taskbar.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Now let's take a look at the Android operating system. With Android, you don't really need to know much about the operating system. The most important thing to know about Android is the settings menu. You access this by dragging down from the top of the screen. The first time you drag, you'll see some of the settings and whatever notifications have appeared on your device. When you drag a second time, you'll get the rest of the settings. You can then swipe left and right for more settings, and you can tap the cogwheel to get even more settings.</strong></p>"

The top bar on the left shows the current tab we are viewing and the button to open another one. On the right, we have three buttons that allow us to control the window. They are the minimize, fullscreen, and close buttons. Below, from left to right, are the navigation buttons, the address bar, which displays the location we are in on the device, and the search bar. On the left side of the window that opens, you will see a list through which you can navigate to different locations on your device.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Every time we create a new thing, like a document, an audio recording, or a video, we create a file. These things are all files, and we need somewhere to store them, hopefully somewhere easy to find the next time we need them. Everything we create on the computer or smartphone is stored in a hard drive. Each operating system has a space called a desktop, which is kind of like a physical desktop in an office. And yes, we can store everything there, but it will soon get unbelievably cluttered, and then we'll never find anything. It's much better to create folders where we can organize our files into some kind of coherent system. How you do that is up to you. And there is no one way that works for everybody.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>To create a new folder, select the desktop from the list on the left and right-click on the free space on the left side of the File Explorer window. A drop down menu will appear, and when you hover your cursor over ""new,"" several additional options will appear. Select ""Folder."" You must do the same to create a file. You can create it inside a folder, or directly on the desktop and then drag and drop it into the selected folder. When creating your first folder, don't forget to give it a name. You can do it right away, or you can right click on a previously created folder and choose ""Rename"" from the dropdown menu. The proper naming of folders and files is very important.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>When you open a folder, for most files you will see only the name, the format, also known as the file type, the creation or modification date, and the size. However, you will not see its contents until you open it. Imagine how inconvenient it would be if in order to find a book on a shelf you had to open each one and check the title page because none of them had a title on the spine. Therefore, remember to name your files and folders in such a way that you can identify what's in them. This will be very useful, especially if you are not the only person who uses these files. Properly named files are easier to search for. When you open a folder or File Explorer, there is a bar with a magnifying glass. If you type a name or a fragment of it there, all files whose names contain the text you type will appear. You can specify the scope of the search simply by selecting a location from the bar or by opening a folder.</strong></p>"

"components/66320469cf2d4204e16c70f8/_html/","<p>Your device can be secured in several ways. When you launch it, you may be asked to enter a password or four-digit PIN code, use a fingerprint reader, or, in the case of touch screens, draw a predetermined symbol. If you decide on a password, it is very important to create a strong one. When you create a new account on a platform, you might be instructed on the conditions your password should meet (minimum number of characters, use of special characters, uppercase and lowercase letters, and numbers). Many platforms will tell you how strong your password is. You can also check it using our tool included in this course.</p>

<p>Before creating a new password, familiarize yourself with the various options:</p>

<h2>1.  Dictionary Words : Common words found in dictionaries.</h2>

<p>Dictionary words are easy to guess because they are common and widely used. Hackers often use dictionary attacks, where they systematically try every word in the dictionary to crack passwords. If you want your accounts to be safe add some symbols and numbers or try using a passphrase.</p>

<h2>2.  Alphanumeric : Combination of letters and numbers.</h2>

<p>An alphanumeric password is harder to crack than a simple dictionary word. Remember not to use common sequences, like 111 or 123. Mix letters and numbers or try leetspeak.</p>

<h2>3.  Symbol Inclusion : Use of special characters like !@#$%^&*().</h2>

<p>Your password includes symbols, that’s a good practice. Remember to avoid putting ! and ? at the end of the password, because it’s where they normally are in a sentence, so it’s easy to guess. Also replacing a with @ in a dictionary word is very popular and might not be enough to make a strong password.</p>

<h2>4.  Passphrases : Longer phrases or sentences.</h2>

<p>A passphrase is safer than a password, but if it only contains dictionary words, it’s still possible to crack it. Try adding numbers, and symbols or turn it into leetspeak.</p>

<h2>5.  Sequential Numbers : Series of numbers in sequence, e.g., 12345.</h2>

<p>That’s very easy to guess. For PINs try using a keyboard pattern (easy to remember but less predictable) or a significant date but not as obvious as your birthday.</p>

<h2>6.  Random Letters : Random assortment of upper and lower case letters.</h3>

<p>Random letter passwords, when properly constructed, can provide strong security. However, it's essential to find a balance between security and usability. The password shouldn’t be too complex to remember or inconvenient to use.</p>

<h2>7.  Leetspeak : Substituting letters with similar-looking numbers/symbols, e.g., pa55w0rd.</h2>

<p>Use longer passwords, as length is a critical factor in password strength. Avoid using common substitutions and patterns. Some Leetspeak substitutions are frequently used, like ""1"" for ""l"" or ""0"" for ""o."" These are among the first substitutions attackers try. Get creative and use less predictable variations.</p>

<h2>8.  Abbreviations : Using initials from a phrase or sentence.</h2>

<p>This is a good way to create a strong password that is easy to remember. An acronym forms a new word like NASA, whereas an initialism is pronounced just as initials like USA. When creating one you should consider the following tips:</p>

<p>Make it as long as the platform allows or that you can comfortably remember. Combine uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters within it. Avoid predictable phrases. Be cautious about using well-known quotes, song lyrics, or easily accessible information as the basis for your acronym or initialism.</p>

<h2>9.  Pattern-Based : Following a specific keyboard pattern, e.g., qwerty.</h2>

<p>Pattern-based passwords may be easy to remember and convenient, but they are typically considered weaker.</p>

<p>To make your pattern-based passwords more secure: Incorporate complexity by mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters into the pattern. Use longer patterns to increase password strength. Avoid using well-known or easily guessable patterns, such as 12345, qwerty, or abcdef.</p>

<h2>10.  Personal Information : Names, dates, or other personal info (not recommended).</h2>

<p>Avoid using personal information in your password, as it may be known or available to be found online for someone trying to break into your account.</p>

<h2>11.  Mixed Category : Combination of two or more categories.</h2>

<p>Mixing a few methods for creating a strong password can give you a very good result, as long as you remember some universal guidelines:</p>

<p>Avoid predictable phrases and patterns. Make your password as long as the platform allows or that you can comfortably remember. Length is a critical factor in password strength.</p>

<h2>12.  System-Generated : Randomly generated by a computer program.</h2>

<p>This type of password or code is created by a computer algorithm without human input. It ensures a high level of randomness and unpredictability, using a strong combination of alphabets, numbers and special symbols to reduce the risk of it being guessed or easily deciphered.</p>

<h2>13.  Memorable Dates : Using significant dates, but in a disguised form.</h2>

<p>These passwords or codes are based on important dates, such as anniversaries or birthdays, but are transformed in a way that makes them less obvious. This approach combines personal significance with a layer of security.</p>

<h2>14.  PIN : Short numeric codes.</h2>

<p>Short for Personal Identification Number, these codes typically consist of a small sequence of digits, often used for quick authentication. PINs are commonly used in banking, phone locks, and other security systems.</p>

<h2>15.  Biometric : Fingerprint or facial recognition (not a typed password but another form of locking a device).</h2>

<p>This security method relies on unique physical characteristics like fingerprints, facial features, or retina patterns to unlock devices or access secure areas. Unlike traditional passwords, biometric authentication offers a more personalized and generally secure approach.</p>"

Don’t worry, your passwords are safe with us; we’re not going to save or store them.Just remember - even if you create the perfect, super-strong password, you still shouldn’t use it for more than one account.<p><Strong>Disclaimer:</Strong> The Password Strength Checker is for learning only and its feedback may not be fully accurate.

"components/b99f2d442d6d4ae89b548343beec55f5/_items/0/body/","<p dir=""ltr"">In the previous module, we looked at the many opportunities offered by modern technology and Internet connectivity. You're already familiar with some examples of everyday tasks that can be significantly simplified with technology. Now, it's time to delve into the technical aspects and get familiar with the tools you'll be using.</p><p dir=""ltr"">For each of the tasks you want to complete, you will need a program or application. This could be a web browser to access specific websites, or a program for editing text files. In order to launch them on your device, the operating system must be running. The operating system is the software that enables you to use your device, provides you with a graphical interface so that you can easily see what is happening and allows applications to run. You will also use it to customize your settings and organize the files you want to use or store on your device.</p><p dir=""ltr"">You can use most websites, programs, and applications on both a computer and a smartphone or tablet. There are also many applications dedicated to touchscreens and those that are much easier to use on a computer, such as office software packages. The most common operating systems are Windows for PC, Mac OS for Apple, Android for smartphones, and iOS for iPhones. There is also Linux, which is very popular with programmers, but it's less easy for beginners. We'll be focusing on Windows and Android, since these are by far the most popular operating systems. But we'll try to be as general as possible. So if you're using a Mac or an iPhone, you'll be able to understand the concepts.</p><p dir=""ltr"">If you are using a desktop computer, you will need several input/output devices. What are they? Input devices are used to enter information, like a keyboard or a mouse, while output devices transmit information to you, such as a monitor or speakers. If you use a laptop, it is equipped with all the necessary components. It has a built-in keyboard, monitor, speakers, microphone, and touchpad, which is the equivalent of a mouse. However, this doesn't mean you can't connect an external keyboard, mouse, or additional monitor. Such a solution may be more convenient if you intend to work for a long time and is often used in office environments. An external keyboard and mouse are more ergonomic and allow you to set the monitor at the right height.</p><p dir=""ltr"">How do these devices connect to each other? They either connect with cables or they connect wirelessly. The basic types of cables you are sure to encounter are USB and HDMI. USB is used to connect external devices like keyboards, hard drives, mice, and trackpads, while HDMI connects monitors. Wireless devices may come with a small USB plug. When inserted into the appropriate socket, the device connects to the computer without a cable. Or they can also connect directly via Bluetooth, which is a system for connecting devices to each other wirelessly. And it works only over a short distance, around 10 meters or 30 feet. Wireless devices require batteries, so if your device stops working, the first thing you should do is check the battery. To connect a device via Bluetooth, you need to enable Bluetooth in the settings menu. On Windows, it will be a dropdown menu on the taskbar, and on a smartphone, it will be the menu that appears when you drag down the home screen. Through Bluetooth, you can also connect an external keyboard to a tablet and use it in a very laptop-like manner.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Let's talk a little more about the operating system, because whichever device you choose, you're going to encounter it. An important part of the operating system interface is the taskbar. This is where you'll find icons for the file explorer, the web browser, and the settings menu. Anytime you open and run an application, an icon will appear here. You can pin the ones you use most often to the taskbar. On the right side of the taskbar is the date and time. If you click on it, the calendar expands. Next to it, you can see icons for battery status, sound, and internet connection. Clicking here reveals more options, such as volume control, screen brightness adjustment, Wi-Fi network selection, airplane mode, and Bluetooth settings. From this menu, you can also access more advanced settings by clicking the cogwheel icon. To get started, you will certainly find File Explorer useful. Here, you'll find out how much storage space your device has, as well as the exact location of the files stored on it. To open the File Explorer, click on the folder icon on the taskbar.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Now let's take a look at the Android operating system. With Android, you don't really need to know much about the operating system. The most important thing to know about Android is the settings menu. You access this by dragging down from the top of the screen. The first time you drag, you'll see some of the settings and whatever notifications have appeared on your device. When you drag a second time, you'll get the rest of the settings. You can then swipe left and right for more settings, and you can tap the cogwheel to get even more settings.</p>"

"components/f6afa876b6004028bf747f6a3d639b80/_items/0/body/","<p dir=""ltr"">Let's take a closer look at the File Explorer window, as many of its elements will also be found in other applications. The top bar on the left shows the current tab we are viewing and the button to open another one. On the right, we have three buttons that allow us to control the window. They are the minimize, fullscreen, and close buttons. Below, from left to right, are the navigation buttons, the address bar, which displays the location we are in on the device, and the search bar. On the left side of the window that opens, you will see a list through which you can navigate to different locations on your device.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Every time we create a new thing, like a document, an audio recording, or a video, we create a file. These things are all files, and we need somewhere to store them, hopefully somewhere easy to find the next time we need them. Everything we create on the computer or smartphone is stored in a hard drive. Each operating system has a space called a desktop, which is kind of like a physical desktop in an office. And yes, we can store everything there, but it will soon get unbelievably cluttered, and then we'll never find anything. It's much better to create folders where we can organize our files into some kind of coherent system. How you do that is up to you. And there is no one way that works for everybody.</p><p dir=""ltr"">To create a new folder, select the desktop from the list on the left and right-click on the free space on the left side of the File Explorer window. A drop down menu will appear, and when you hover your cursor over ""new,"" several additional options will appear. Select ""Folder."" You must do the same to create a file. You can create it inside a folder, or directly on the desktop and then drag and drop it into the selected folder. When creating your first folder, don't forget to give it a name. You can do it right away, or you can right click on a previously created folder and choose ""Rename"" from the dropdown menu. The proper naming of folders and files is very important.</p><p dir=""ltr"">When you open a folder, for most files you will see only the name, the format, also known as the file type, the creation or modification date, and the size. However, you will not see its contents until you open it. Imagine how inconvenient it would be if in order to find a book on a shelf you had to open each one and check the title page because none of them had a title on the spine. Therefore, remember to name your files and folders in such a way that you can identify what's in them. This will be very useful, especially if you are not the only person who uses these files. Properly named files are easier to search for. When you open a folder or File Explorer, there is a bar with a magnifying glass. If you type a name or a fragment of it there, all files whose names contain the text you type will appear. You can specify the scope of the search simply by selecting a location from the bar or by opening a folder.</p>"
