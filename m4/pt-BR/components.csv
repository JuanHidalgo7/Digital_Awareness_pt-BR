"components/662f8e3ceec87d00843ac01a/_transcript/inlineTranscriptBody/","<p dir=""ltr""><strong>AI has entered our daily lives with the introduction of services like ChatGPT and MidJourney. But even before natural language processing chatbots and image-generating services became popular, AI had been widely used in many fields, from science and robotics to medicine and transportation. Since the use of AI is so prevalent, let's explore what it entails and how it came to be. AI is a field of computer science, creating machines and software that can replicate human abilities, such as learning, problem solving. Just like people learn from their experiences, AI learns from the data it's given.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>People have imagined creating artificial yet intelligent beings for centuries. However, the most important steps towards realizing this dream were made in the 1950s. The term artificial intelligence was first used in 1956 at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, where a group of scientists aimed to verify the claim that machines can simulate any aspect of learning or other characteristics of intelligence, if described precisely enough. Over the decades, AI research has evolved significantly, driven by advances in computing power, algorithms, and data availability. Major milestones include the development of expert systems in the 1970s, neural networks in the 1980s, and the rise of machine learning algorithms in the 21st century. Today, AI is characterized by sophisticated algorithms capable of learning from vast amounts of data to perform tasks that were once thought to require human intelligence.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>In the last decade, one of the most important advancements in the AI field was Large Language Models, or LLMs. LLMs are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of data using deep learning techniques capable of understanding and generating human-like text. They can also perform complex tasks such as translation, summarizing text, answering questions, analyzing systems, recognizing patterns, and categorizing content. With their ability to comprehend and generate contextually relevant responses, Large Language Models are playing an increasingly vital role in various applications, including customer service, content generation, and academic research.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>AI itself is neither inherently good nor bad. The outcomes of an AI system depend on how it is designed, utilized, and the intentions behind its implementation. Even though we tend to think of technologies as neutral tools, their creation is always influenced by current beliefs and views of the world. Ethical problems may occur when human biases and prejudices become part of automated decision making systems or find their way into datasets on which AI systems are trained. Factors such as the design choices made during development, the data used to train the system, and the context in which it operates all influence whether the AI system yields positive or negative effects on society. Moreover, individuals or organizations responsible for creating and deploying AI, as well as the purposes for which it is employed, play crucial roles in shaping its impact.</strong></p>"

Netiquette is the etiquette for the internet. Why do you need it?</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Online platforms and communicators are just tools for connecting with others, so all the rules of conduct should still apply. However, it is much easier to forget good manners while communicating online, as it does not feel as personal and creates a sense of anonymity, which does not exist in real life. You need to always remember that there is a real person on the other side of the screen and that you want to use digital technologies to enhance your social interactions. So, to make sure you know how to conduct yourself appropriately in any online situation, follow a few simple rules.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Be respectful. Treat others with kindness and respect, just as you would in face-to-face interactions.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Think before you post. Take a moment to consider the potential impact of your words or actions before sharing them online. Remember that even though it may feel casual, once you put something on the internet, it is there forever.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Be careful with humor or sarcasm. Online communication has its limitations and you can be easily misunderstood.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Respect privacy. Refrain from sharing personal information, private conversations, or photos and videos without consent. Be mindful of the boundaries of online spaces and communities.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Maintain personal boundaries. It is essential for preserving your privacy and well-being in the digital world. Think carefully about the information you share online and consider how it may be perceived by others. Again, remember, once on the internet, always on the internet.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>By practicing these principles, you can navigate the digital world with confidence, empathy, and respect for others, fostering positive and meaningful interactions online.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Now that you can navigate the digital world with proper netiquette, you should know that the internet also serves as a powerful platform for collaborative work. Through email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and collaborative software tools, people can easily exchange ideas, documents, and feedback in real time. Additionally, cloud storage solutions allow for access to shared files and documents from anywhere with an internet connection, and enable teamwork across diverse locations.</strong></p>"

Netiquette is the etiquette for the internet. Why do you need it?</p><p dir=""ltr"">Online platforms and communicators are just tools for connecting with others, so all the rules of conduct should still apply. However, it is much easier to forget good manners while communicating online, as it does not feel as personal and creates a sense of anonymity, which does not exist in real life. You need to always remember that there is a real person on the other side of the screen and that you want to use digital technologies to enhance your social interactions. So, to make sure you know how to conduct yourself appropriately in any online situation, follow a few simple rules.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Be respectful. Treat others with kindness and respect, just as you would in face-to-face interactions.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Think before you post. Take a moment to consider the potential impact of your words or actions before sharing them online. Remember that even though it may feel casual, once you put something on the internet, it is there forever.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Be careful with humor or sarcasm. Online communication has its limitations and you can be easily misunderstood.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Respect privacy. Refrain from sharing personal information, private conversations, or photos and videos without consent. Be mindful of the boundaries of online spaces and communities.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Maintain personal boundaries. It is essential for preserving your privacy and well-being in the digital world. Think carefully about the information you share online and consider how it may be perceived by others. Again, remember, once on the internet, always on the internet.</p><p dir=""ltr"">By practicing these principles, you can navigate the digital world with confidence, empathy, and respect for others, fostering positive and meaningful interactions online.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Now that you can navigate the digital world with proper netiquette, you should know that the internet also serves as a powerful platform for collaborative work. Through email, instant messaging, video conferencing, and collaborative software tools, people can easily exchange ideas, documents, and feedback in real time. Additionally, cloud storage solutions allow for access to shared files and documents from anywhere with an internet connection, and enable teamwork across diverse locations.</p>"

"components/a7c98a92c08f4986a3c1b3db6294f4da/_items/0/body/","<p dir=""ltr"">AI has entered our daily lives with the introduction of services like ChatGPT and MidJourney. But even before natural language processing chatbots and image-generating services became popular, AI had been widely used in many fields, from science and robotics to medicine and transportation. Since the use of AI is so prevalent, let's explore what it entails and how it came to be. AI is a field of computer science, creating machines and software that can replicate human abilities, such as learning, problem solving. Just like people learn from their experiences, AI learns from the data it's given.</p><p dir=""ltr"">People have imagined creating artificial yet intelligent beings for centuries. However, the most important steps towards realizing this dream were made in the 1950s. The term artificial intelligence was first used in 1956 at a workshop held on the campus of Dartmouth College, where a group of scientists aimed to verify the claim that machines can simulate any aspect of learning or other characteristics of intelligence, if described precisely enough. Over the decades, AI research has evolved significantly, driven by advances in computing power, algorithms, and data availability. Major milestones include the development of expert systems in the 1970s, neural networks in the 1980s, and the rise of machine learning algorithms in the 21st century. Today, AI is characterized by sophisticated algorithms capable of learning from vast amounts of data to perform tasks that were once thought to require human intelligence.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In the last decade, one of the most important advancements in the AI field was Large Language Models, or LLMs. LLMs are advanced AI systems trained on vast amounts of data using deep learning techniques capable of understanding and generating human-like text. They can also perform complex tasks such as translation, summarizing text, answering questions, analyzing systems, recognizing patterns, and categorizing content. With their ability to comprehend and generate contextually relevant responses, Large Language Models are playing an increasingly vital role in various applications, including customer service, content generation, and academic research.</p><p dir=""ltr"">AI itself is neither inherently good nor bad. The outcomes of an AI system depend on how it is designed, utilized, and the intentions behind its implementation. Even though we tend to think of technologies as neutral tools, their creation is always influenced by current beliefs and views of the world. Ethical problems may occur when human biases and prejudices become part of automated decision making systems or find their way into datasets on which AI systems are trained. Factors such as the design choices made during development, the data used to train the system, and the context in which it operates all influence whether the AI system yields positive or negative effects on society. Moreover, individuals or organizations responsible for creating and deploying AI, as well as the purposes for which it is employed, play crucial roles in shaping its impact.</p>"
