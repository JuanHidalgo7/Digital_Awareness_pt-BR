"components/6630da6c1baafd0375c689b9/_transcript/inlineTranscriptBody/","<p dir=""ltr""><strong>There are many platforms that offer online courses where you can sign up through a website and start learning today. For example, Cisco Networking Academy and OpenEDG Edube are great places to learn technology topics like cybersecurity, networking, programming, or data science, and gain the skills you need to earn a certification or land a job. Some platforms have options to choose if you want to learn self-paced online, find an instructor-led class in person, or do a hybrid of both. There are many learning platforms out there, and while some are free, others might have a cost. Here's how they work in simple steps.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>First, you create an account. All learning platforms need you to have an account so that they can connect the courses you enroll in, and so that you can track your progress. You usually need to provide some basic information, like your name and email address. Some platforms, like this one, are free, and some you have to pay for. If you have to pay, then you'll need to have a credit or debit card, and you can enter the information when you get to the payment screen.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Once you've signed in, you can browse through different courses. Courses are like individual classes, focusing on specific topics. Some platforms have quizzes and tests, and you can track your performance, while others are simpler and just give you the content.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>When picking a course, you'll get access to various materials. These could be videos, where an instructor talks and shows you how to do something. There could also be readings, which are like textbook chapters you can read on your screen. As we said, some courses include quizzes to test what you've learned. All the platforms offer self-paced learning, which means you learn by yourself and go at your own pace. But some also offer instructor or teacher-led courses, which means you join a class and are guided by the instructor or the teacher.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Many platforms let you ask questions or discuss things with instructors and other learners. This is usually done through a comments section or a forum. It's like raising your hand in a classroom, but online. Some platforms have video interaction, so you can feel like you're actually in a class and can talk not only to the teacher, but to the other students as well.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Some platforms offer a certificate when you finish the course. It's a way to show what you've learned, like getting a diploma after graduation.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>In addition to a completion certificate, many courses are aligned to specific exams. Once you've completed the course, you should have all the knowledge and skills to pass the exam. This can be particularly useful if you want to add to your resume or CV, or maybe you just want to test yourself to see how far you've come.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Online learning platforms make it easy for anyone to learn new things in a flexible and user-friendly way. Whether you want to pick up a hobby or gain skills for a job, these platforms open up a world of knowledge right at your fingertips.</strong></p>"

<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Now that you’ve done the quiz and identified a few skills gaps, pick one and try to learn it for yourself. The first thing you’ll need to do is find the resources to help you learn, and there are several that are great places to start.</p>"

<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">The first is online courses. There are many platforms where you can sign up and start learning, like Cisco Networking Academy, or OpenEDG Edube. These are great places to learn programming and computer-related skills. There are many more platforms available, and some of them are free, and some of them require you to pay.

<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Another great resource is video streaming platforms. The biggest is YouTube, and here you’ll find video tutorials that will take you step-by-step through a skill or task, like signing up to a website, using an online shopping cart, or even writing your own code to perform a very specific function. The video tutorials should be familiar to you, because they are similar in style to the ones on this course.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">MOOCs are offered by universities and colleges worldwide, providing access to high-quality education resources for free or at a low cost. They cover both academic subjects and practical skills, offering certificates upon completion. Some of them, like the Open University, even offer complete Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">In the real world, if you want to learn more about a topic, you will probably read a book. Nothing has changed in the digital world. Digital libraries and websites offer a vast amount of written content ranging from textbooks to in-depth articles on specific skills or knowledge areas. These resources are ideal for self-paced learners who prefer reading. The only difference is that you no longer read the book on paper, but instead you read it on a screen. You might prefer paper, and that’s a fair point, but think about how much money each book costs, and if you’re a student and you have to quote from 10 or 20 books for your essay, you’ll save a lot of money by compromising on the screen.</p>

<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Live sessions or recorded webinars provide an interactive way to learn directly from experts. A webinar is a video that is streamed across the internet, that you can either watch as it’s happening, or watch the recording later. Many companies and individuals offer monthly webinars for free. These can cover niche topics or offer overviews of broader subjects, often with the opportunity to ask questions. Usually the free webinars are more general, and you will probably have to pay if you want to dive deep into a subject.</p>

"components/6633743ed2c600060ed6b667/_html/","
<p style=""font-size: 20px;"">Social media is not just for sharing pictures of cats. There are plenty of groups out there that focus on specific topics, and if you join one of these groups, you can ask questions about the things you don’t know, and help others learn the things you do know.
You might have noticed that new technology doesn’t come with an instruction manual, the way things used to in the past. That’s because those instruction manuals have moved online. Most companies that create products will have their instruction manuals on their websites, but some don’t even have those. Instead, they have forums. A forum is a place where you can go and ask a question related to that product, and either a representative from the company will answer it, or somebody else who knows the answer. If you like the answer you get, you can give it a thumbs up. This is called upvoting, and the idea is that the best answers get voted to the top of the page, so that the next person who has the same question will be able to see that answer straight away.

This tutorial guides you through fixing some common problems with simple solutions.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Step one, check the power source. Ensure your device is charged or plugged in. Step 2. Inspect power cables and outlets for any signs of damage or disconnection. Step 3. Press and hold the power button for a longer duration than usual, say 10 to 20 seconds.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Step 1. Free up storage. Delete unnecessary files and uninstall unused apps. Hard drives tend to perform slower when they're full, so freeing up space usually allows them to work faster. Step 2. Close background applications. On most devices, you can see which apps are running and manually close them. Step 3. Restart your device to clear temporary files and stop unseen processes. When you launch an application, a bunch of background processes are launched at the same time. When you close the application, not all of those background processes are terminated and they can slow down the performance of the computer. So if you find that that's the case, restarting your computer will terminate all these processes.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Problem three, connectivity issues. Step one, ensure wifi is enabled on your device and you're selecting the correct network. Step 2. Verify the problem is with your device or your Wi-Fi connection by trying to connect to the same Wi-Fi with another device. Step 3. Restart your router by unplugging it for 30 seconds and then plugging it back in.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Step 1. Click the Forgot Password link on the login page of the service you're trying to access. Step 2. Follow the prompts, which usually involves receiving an email with a reset link. Step 3. Create a new password.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Step 1. Check for updates. Open the App Store or software's official website and download any available updates. Software creators often provide updates to fix bugs or to patch security holes that have been discovered. Step two, if updating doesn't work, then reinstall the application. Uninstall it first, then download and install the latest version. This usually does the trick.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Step 1. Identify the file type. Look at the file extension, like .pdf or .docx. Step 2. If you're trying to open an unusual file type, then it's possible that you don't have an application on your device that is capable of reading that file type. In this case, you'll need to download a compatible application that can open this file type. Step 3. Convert the file online if it's still not opening using a file format converter tool. These can work well, but be aware that you have to upload the file to the internet, which means that other people might see the contents of the file. If your file contains sensitive information, this may not be an option.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p dir=""ltr""><strong>Many issues are resolved by simply restarting your device, giving it a fresh start. Ensure your device's operating system and applications are up to date for optimal performance and security. Most digital devices and applications offer a help or support section. Look here for specific guidance related to your problem. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to seek assistance from customer support, online forums, or tech-savvy friends. By following these steps, you can tackle common technical problems with confidence. Remember, the key is to approach each issue methodically, using these guidelines to navigate your way to a solution.</strong></p>"

This tutorial guides you through fixing some common problems with simple solutions.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Step one, check the power source. Ensure your device is charged or plugged in. Step 2. Inspect power cables and outlets for any signs of damage or disconnection. Step 3. Press and hold the power button for a longer duration than usual, say 10 to 20 seconds.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Step 1. Free up storage. Delete unnecessary files and uninstall unused apps. Hard drives tend to perform slower when they're full, so freeing up space usually allows them to work faster. Step 2. Close background applications. On most devices, you can see which apps are running and manually close them. Step 3. Restart your device to clear temporary files and stop unseen processes. When you launch an application, a bunch of background processes are launched at the same time. When you close the application, not all of those background processes are terminated and they can slow down the performance of the computer. So if you find that that's the case, restarting your computer will terminate all these processes.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Problem three, connectivity issues. Step one, ensure wifi is enabled on your device and you're selecting the correct network. Step 2. Verify the problem is with your device or your Wi-Fi connection by trying to connect to the same Wi-Fi with another device. Step 3. Restart your router by unplugging it for 30 seconds and then plugging it back in.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Step 1. Click the Forgot Password link on the login page of the service you're trying to access. Step 2. Follow the prompts, which usually involves receiving an email with a reset link. Step 3. Create a new password.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Step 1. Check for updates. Open the App Store or software's official website and download any available updates. Software creators often provide updates to fix bugs or to patch security holes that have been discovered. Step two, if updating doesn't work, then reinstall the application. Uninstall it first, then download and install the latest version. This usually does the trick.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Step 1. Identify the file type. Look at the file extension, like .pdf or .docx. Step 2. If you're trying to open an unusual file type, then it's possible that you don't have an application on your device that is capable of reading that file type. In this case, you'll need to download a compatible application that can open this file type. Step 3. Convert the file online if it's still not opening using a file format converter tool. These can work well, but be aware that you have to upload the file to the internet, which means that other people might see the contents of the file. If your file contains sensitive information, this may not be an option.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Many issues are resolved by simply restarting your device, giving it a fresh start. Ensure your device's operating system and applications are up to date for optimal performance and security. Most digital devices and applications offer a help or support section. Look here for specific guidance related to your problem. If you're stuck, don't hesitate to seek assistance from customer support, online forums, or tech-savvy friends. By following these steps, you can tackle common technical problems with confidence.

"components/f542b899e531420a916e55d346265e71/_items/0/body/","<p dir=""ltr"">There are many platforms that offer online courses where you can sign up through a website and start learning today. For example, Cisco Networking Academy and OpenEDG Edube are great places to learn technology topics like cybersecurity, networking, programming, or data science, and gain the skills you need to earn a certification or land a job. Some platforms have options to choose if you want to learn self-paced online, find an instructor-led class in person, or do a hybrid of both. There are many learning platforms out there, and while some are free, others might have a cost. Here's how they work in simple steps.</p><p dir=""ltr"">First, you create an account. All learning platforms need you to have an account so that they can connect the courses you enroll in, and so that you can track your progress. You usually need to provide some basic information, like your name and email address. Some platforms, like this one, are free, and some you have to pay for. If you have to pay, then you'll need to have a credit or debit card, and you can enter the information when you get to the payment screen.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Once you've signed in, you can browse through different courses. Courses are like individual classes, focusing on specific topics. Some platforms have quizzes and tests, and you can track your performance, while others are simpler and just give you the content.</p><p dir=""ltr"">When picking a course, you'll get access to various materials. These could be videos, where an instructor talks and shows you how to do something. There could also be readings, which are like textbook chapters you can read on your screen. As we said, some courses include quizzes to test what you've learned. All the platforms offer self-paced learning, which means you learn by yourself and go at your own pace. But some also offer instructor or teacher-led courses, which means you join a class and are guided by the instructor or the teacher.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Many platforms let you ask questions or discuss things with instructors and other learners. This is usually done through a comments section or a forum. It's like raising your hand in a classroom, but online. Some platforms have video interaction, so you can feel like you're actually in a class and can talk not only to the teacher, but to the other students as well.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Some platforms offer a certificate when you finish the course. It's a way to show what you've learned, like getting a diploma after graduation.</p><p dir=""ltr"">In addition to a completion certificate, many courses are aligned to specific exams. Once you've completed the course, you should have all the knowledge and skills to pass the exam. This can be particularly useful if you want to add to your resume or CV, or maybe you just want to test yourself to see how far you've come.</p><p dir=""ltr"">Online learning platforms make it easy for anyone to learn new things in a flexible and user-friendly way. Whether you want to pick up a hobby or gain skills for a job, these platforms open up a world of knowledge right at your fingertips.</p>"
